# AI Lab 3 - Zain Abdullah

This repository contains solutions for various basic Python programming tasks, designed for an introductory Artificial Intelligence lab.

## Contents

- **Task 1:** Student grading and average calculation
- **Task 2:** Word frequency counter for a sentence
- **Task 3:** Simple chatbot with predefined responses
- **Task 4:** Movie recommender by genre
- **Task 5:** Activity suggestion based on weather
- **Task 6:** Number analysis (max, min, average, above average)
- **Task 7:** Student report card generator with grades and topper

All code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook: [`AI_lab_3_zain_abdullah.ipynb`](AI_lab_3_zain_abdullah.ipynb)

## Requirements

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (recommended) or Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. **Install Anaconda**  
   Download and install Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Open Jupyter Notebook**  
   Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook, or run the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**  
   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the folder containing `AI_lab_3_zain_abdullah.ipynb` and open it.

4. **Run the Code**  
   Execute each cell in order. Some cells require user input in the notebook interface.

## What the Code Does

- **Task 1:**  
  Prints each student's marks and grade, then calculates and prints the class average.

- **Task 2:**  
  Asks the user for a sentence, counts the frequency of each word, and identifies the most used word.

- **Task 3:**  
  A simple chatbot that responds to specific user inputs.

- **Task 4:**  
  Recommends a random movie from a genre chosen by the user.

- **Task 5:**  
  Suggests an activity based on the weather condition entered by the user.

- **Task 6:**  
  Analyzes a list of numbers entered by the user, showing the max, min, average, and numbers above average.

- **Task 7:**  
  Takes student names and marks as input, prints a report with grades and pass/fail status, shows the class average, and identifies the topper.

**Note:**  
All tasks are implemented in Python and require user interaction via input prompts in the notebook.
